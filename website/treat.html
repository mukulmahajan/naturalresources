1) Enabling policy and institutional environment

Decentralization policies have potential to encourage the evolution of community-based institutions to manage natural resources locally. The propensity of individuals to organize themselves into institutions for collective action will be partly determined by the expected pay-offs. The benefits of cooperative management will, in turn, be affected by the:<br>
nature of property rights for resources (i.e., whether private or common, and how well-defined)<br>
legal status of community-based institutions and whether they have authority to manage financial resources, levy user charges, enforce compliance with exclusion orders, etc.<br>
macro-economic conditions affecting the financial viability of small producers<br>
extent of rural infrastructure which affects the ease of access to arkets for local producers<br>
2) Participatory processes for establishing community-based groups<br>

Evidence suggests that community-based groups are an effective means of managing the free-rider problems associated with most resource management regimes. Decentralization policies on their own, however, are not necessarily sufficient to result in the formation of these community-based groups. Catalytic external agencies using participatory processes are also required to facilitate and build local organizational capacity, effective community participation, and local control and authority over decisions and resources. Important issues to consider in strengthening local organizational capacity are:<br>
entry point subprojects that result in positive financial and/or economic returns to local communities while attaining sustainable resource management goals - the incentive for collective action<br>
benefits from management of natural resources must accrue quickly, locally, transparently, and as equitably as possible given the resource constraints - providing incentives to as many resource users as possible<br>
externalities and asymmetric costs and benefits associated with most natural resource management activities means that appropriate financial incentives are required for co-financing entry point subprojects with local communities -- improving the incentives<br>
3) Effective operational linkages between institutional actors to facilitate large-scale adoption of sustainable NRM practices.<br>

There are many successful examples of using participatory processes for the formation of local management systems. However, most of these successes only operate on a small scale. The challenge lies in creating the conditions for large-scale adoption of successful community-based management systems. This requires effective operational linkages between the public sector, private sector, and community-based groups. Issues to be considered include: <br>
review and restructuring of public sector agencies to become more responsive to clients<br>
decentralization of responsibility and authority for resource management decisions to the most appropriate level (subsidiarity)<br>
design of appropriate decentralized financial instrument (e.g., social fund, demand driven rural investment fund, or local development fund) for financing community-based resource management initiatives<br>
decentralized financial instruments must enable community-based local procurement of goods and services.<br>
