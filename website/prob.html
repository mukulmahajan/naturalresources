<p>Natural resource management refers to the management of natural <br>
resources such as land, water, soil, plants and animals, with a particular focus<br>
 on how management affects the quality of life for both present and future generations (stewardship).<br>

Natural resource management deals with managing the way in which people and natural <br>
landscapes interact. It brings together land use planning, water management, biodiversity<br>
 conservation, and the future sustainability of industries like agriculture, mining, tourism, <br>
fisheries and forestry. It recognises that people and their livelihoods rely on the health and <br>
productivity of our landscapes, and their actions as stewards of the land play a critical role <br>
in maintaining this health and productivity.<br>

Natural resource management specifically focuses on a scientific and technical understanding <br>
of resources and ecology and the life-supporting capacity of those resources. Environmental<br>
 management is also similar to natural resource management. In academic contexts, the sociology <br>
of natural resources is closely related to, but distinct from, natural resource management.</p>
