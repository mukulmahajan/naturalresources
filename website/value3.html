<p>Why should we bother about the value of nature? Isn’t the fact that nature<br>
 is deteriorating, the climate is changing; resources are getting depleted, etc.<br>
 enough reason to protect environment and nature to the limit?<br>

Of course this is a legitimate argument, but in many cases this will not be sufficient<br>
 to convince people with other ethical values (for example “making money)<br>

Reasons to bother about monetary valuation of environmental and natural resources are:<br>

Environmental valuation techniques can provide useful evidence to support habitat<br>
 conservation policies by quantifying the economic value associated with the protection of biological resources.<br>

Pearce 2001 argues that the measurement of the economic value of biodiversity is a <br>
fundamental step in conserving this resource, since “the pressures to reduce biodiversity<br>
 are so large that the chances that we will introduce incentives [for the protection of biodiversity]<br>
 without demonstrating the economic value of biodiversity are much less than if we do engage in valuation.<br>

By assigning monetary values to biodiversity, the benefits associated with biodiversity can <br>
directly be compared with the economic value of alternative resource use options it thus can<br>
 and should be applied in Cost Benefit Analyses of (larger) public and private projects (Jochem Jantzen, 2006)<br>
